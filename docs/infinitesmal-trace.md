# Tracing via infinitsemals
Placeholder for shortest-path approach that uses immediate gradient.

Remember the Fourier coefficients of the template function, $[c_{1, 0}, \cdots, c_{n, 0}]$ (just using an alternate notation to the $S_i(t)$ to help clarify my thoughts).  Suppose, that we can nudge each coefficient some small distance toward its corresponding target coefficient (i.e. toward $[c_{1, 1}, \cdots, c_{n, 1}]$)
