# Exploration of linear tracing in 1D
Starting at the minimum of the template function, $x_0$, we want to construct a line that passes through $x_0$ while minimizing the vertical distance it travels.  

We can begin my writing the general form of the lineIf F is our morphing function, then we have:

$$
\LARGE
z_0 + t\vec{u}=(x, F(x, t))
$$

Where $\vec{u}$ is the direction of the line, and $t\in[0, 1]$.  The intercept of the line, $\large z_0$, and can be written as 

$$\LARGE z_0=(x_0, + F(x_0, 0))$$.
